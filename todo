DONE 1. time picker should start at now time
2. all fasts should show only last X amont
3. graph in the top of the last fasts

Add timezone to times display
AS when i went to the UK the time went back one hour on my phone
and the time reflected the new timezone in the app
so i essentially lost an hour of fasting time, really it should stick to the
timezone that I started the fast in... that would be the accurate version of
how long i fasted for...
